## Setting up python environment (`Windows`)

1. Install miniconda to get a python installation in you local system.

   The Windows installation for Miniconda can be found [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe).
   During the Miniconda installation, ensure that conda is added to the local PATH environment variable.
   
2. Open `Anaconda Prompt`, and the following:
  ```bash
      pip install <package_name>
      
      e.g...    pip install numpy
  ```
   If you face an error, while installing using `pip`, try:  
   ```
      conda install <package_name
      
      e.g... conda install numpy
   ```
   
 3.  For managing `conda` environments follow this [link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
      

## Setting up python environment (`Linux`)

1. For Linux installation guide from terminal follow this [link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html).

2. Once miniconda is installed then reopen the terminal.

3. To install any python modules, Follow the same instruction as in `Windows`

        - conda install <package_name> 
                    OR
        - pip install <package_name>

        e.g.
            - conda install jupyter
            - conda install matplotlib
